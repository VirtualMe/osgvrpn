An application demonstrating additions to the osgVRPN plugin.

Simple application demonstrating the walled mode capabilites of the VRManipulator.
While in a walled mode setting, orientation data from the manipulator is not used.
The VRManipulator's navigation functions work in a Y up coordinate system; the 
home matrix calls reflect this.

Any joystick can be used for rotation (even in walled mode).  Moves around the Y axis,
giving a full view of the stadium.

Original plugin created by Mike Weiblen.
